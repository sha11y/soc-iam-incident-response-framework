 # CFC ↔ IAM Standardized Incident Response Playbook

A pre-defined engagement framework for identity-based incident response,
developed to eliminate real-time negotiation between Cyber Fusion Center 
(SOC) and Identity & Access Management teams during active incidents.

## What This Covers

- **Engagement SOP** — communication channels, escalation path, and IAM response SLAs
- **Checklist 1** — Identity type classification across 8 identity categories
- **Checklist 2** — Compromise validation and confidence level determination
- **Checklist 3** — Containment steps by identity type (4 response paths)
- **Checklist 4** — Recovery controls and pre-recovery gate requirements
- **Checklist 5** — Post-incident governance hardening
- **Scenario Playbooks** — 5 pre-defined end-to-end playbooks for the most common identity incidents

## Scenario Playbooks Included

1. Credential Theft — Standard Workforce User (Phishing)
2. Privilege Escalation — CyberArk-Managed Admin Account
3. Service Account Credential Theft — Critical Business Process
4. MFA Bypass — AiTM Attack Against Elevated Workforce User
5. Lateral Movement — Active Breach Across Multiple Identities

## Design Principle

The first time CFC and IAM work through an incident together 
shouldn't be during an active breach at 2am.
